        <p>A list of minimal pairs illustrated by images, audio, and spelled out words. It allows you to "train your ear" in discriminating similar sounds in pairs of words. You can learn through simple listening activities. The filter option allows you to focus on a combination of sounds you select (e.g. b vs. p); you can also listen to any random pairs of sounds (All vs. all).</p>
        <p> Additional libraries can be purchased.</p>
        
        <p>To use learn:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Make sure the filter is adjusted to your preferred settings (Are these the sounds you want to listen to?) Click <img src="mFilter.png" align="top"/> to select the sounds you want to learn and follow the steps for Filter (above).</li>
                
            <li> Tap an image to hear how the word sounds. Each word is spelled out under the corresponding image.</li>
                
            <li> Tap the corresponding word to hear the difference between the two sounds (only one sound is different in each minimal pair. Can you hear the difference?
                
            <li> When you are ready move to the next step: Practice</li>
        </ol>
